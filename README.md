A web application that generates certain preset.XML's for the synthstrom deluge.

KITS:

How to:
drag and drop your .wav samples onto the dropzone and catagorize / re-order them how you want.
once you are satisfied with your list and order of your samples, you can pick a name for your preset in the text field up top.
you can also spin the cog (click the button) to let it generate a name for you!

MULTISAMPLES:

the idea for the multisample preset generator is, converting Decent Sampler multisampled instruments into deluge multisamples.
or otherwise create your own multisample preset through the decent sampler or native synthstrom file naming convention.
this is not yet implemented, and there's no ETA for it as well.
